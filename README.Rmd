# Learning Shiny

<!-- badges: start -->

This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of
[Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by Hadley Wickham.

WATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore
neither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.

I wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to
become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.
Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner.
