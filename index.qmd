#### This is work in progress

I have finished about 48%. Currently I am working on chapter 10 Dynamic UI.

The missing @sec-chap04_8_exercises 4.8 will be worked out in the next few days.

I am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces
me to become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more
carefully. Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an
expert but by a learner.

Text passages with content I am already familiar I have skipped. Section
of the original text where I needed more in-depth knowledge I have
elaborated and added my own comments resulted from my personal research.

Be warned! In spite of replicating most of the content this Quarto book
may contain many mistakes. All the misapprehensions and errors are of
course my own responsibility.

## Content and Goals of this Book {.unnumbered}

This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of
[Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by Hadley Wickham
[@wickham2021].

I am learning wot work with {**shiny**} because I want to develop a
dashboard for investigating countries in world maps with values of
different years. For instance I want to use the `r glossary("WHR")` data
2011, 2012, 2014-2024 and show the distributions of the ladder scores
abount the countries of the world.

## Text passages

### Quotes and personal comments

My text consists mostly of quotes from the [Mastering Shiny
book](https://www.amazon.de/Mastering-Shiny-Interactive-Reports-Dashboards/dp/1492047384/).
Sometimes I have them changed slightly to adapt it to the flow of my
notes. But I have not shown that it is a quote nor I jave referenced the
position of the (semi)quotes in the book. As I am generally follow the
book's outline using the same text for headers, it should be clear where
to find the quotes.

This means that most of the text in this Quarto book is not mine but
comes from different resources.

My personal comments should be clear because most of the times it is a
reflection about the book and my experiences with it.

### Glossary

I am using the {**glossary**} package [@glossary] to create links to
glossary entries.

:::::: my-r-code
:::: my-r-code-header
::: {#cnj-load-glossary}
: Load glossary
:::
::::

::: my-r-code-container
```{r}
#| label: load-glossary
#| lst-label: lst-preface-load-glossary
#| lst-cap: "Install and load the glossary package with the appropriate glossary.yml file"


## 1. Install the glossary package:
## https://debruine.github.io/glossary/

library(glossary)

## If you want to use my glossary.yml file:

## 1. fork my repo
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb

## 2. Download the `glossary.yml` file from
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml)

## 3. Store the file on your hard disk
##    and change the following path accordingly

glossary::glossary_path("../glossary-pb/glossary.yml")

```
:::
::::::

If you hover with your mouse over the double underlined links it opens
an window with the appropriate glossary text. Try this example:
`r glossary("WHR")`.

![](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/logo.png)

I have added many of the glossary entries when I was working through
other books either taking the text passage of these books I was reading
or via an internet recherche from other resources. Sometimes I have
added the source of the glossary entry as an abbreviation or as an URL.
Many definitions were provided by the KI provided within the search of
my [Brave browser](https://brave.com/).
:::
::::
::::::

If you fork [my repository of these
notes](https://github.com/petzi53/learning-shiny) then the glossary will
not work out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file from [my
glossary-pb GitHub
repo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),
store it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk
@lst-preface-load-glossary accordingly.

In any case I am the only responsible person for the glossary text,
especially if I have used text from other resources wrongly. Again: The
main purpose of the glossary is to support my personal learning venture.

## R Code and Datasets

During coding I am following the [Tidyverse Style
Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and the conventions explained in
[Rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/software-info.html), [@xie2018] a book written with {**bookdown**} [@xie2017], a predecessor of Quarto.


-   There are no prompts (`>` and `+`) to R source code.
-   The text output is commented out with two hashes `##` by default.
    This is for your convenience when you want to copy and run the code.
    The text output will be ignored since it is commented out.
-   Inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g.,
    `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`).
-   Package names are also formatted in a typewriter font but bold an in
    curly parenthesis (e.g., {**rmarkdown**})[^index-1].
-   Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g.,
    `bookdown::render_book()`). The double-colon operator `::` means
    accessing an object from a package.
    

[^index-1]: The parenthesis are my own addition not applied in the
    mentioned RMarkdown book.
    
Additionally I am adopting the following convention: Whenever I use `Shiny` with capital letter I am referring to the app. In contrast to {**shiny**} which is pointing to the R package.

For learning purposes I am practicing {**shiny**} in two modes:

1.  **{shiny} app**: I am writing the code in extra `app.R` files as
    explained in the book. I create folders with the number of the
    chapters, eg., `apps-01`, `apps-02`. Inside of these chapter folders
    I put the folders for the {**shiny**} examples with self explanatory
    names so that one can get and distinguish the example files that all
    have the name `app.R`. Additionally I order these examples with
    numbers that represents their appearance in the text, e.g.,
    `01-hello-world`, `02-greetings1` `03-greetings2`, etc.
2.  **{shinylife-r}**: Additionally I provide the example as standalone
    {**shinylive**} Quarto examples. They have two different version:
    One is the source code shown as code listing but not evaluated. The
    other is the working {**shinylive**} example. This seems to me a
    nice way to communicate my learning experiences and the results of
    the {**shiny**} code. All these code chunks start with
    `{shinylive-r}` instead `{r}` in the header.

::: callout-caution
I am not using always the exact code snippets of the book, because I am
not only replicating the code to see how it works but also to change the
values of parameters to observe their influences.
:::

## Annex

In some of my book notes I provide files in the annex. They contain
experiments not directly in line with the book but inspired by my
reading of the book.

Often you will also find an annex file with a standardized short
description of all my used packages, sometimes added with notes about my
personal experiences with this package. An example of the standardized
format gives you the following @sec-glossary-package.

### Glossary package {#sec-glossary-package}

<center>{**glossary**}: [Glossaries for Markdown and Quarto
Documents](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/) [@glossary]</center>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {layout="[10, 30]" layout-valign="center"}
![](img/logoi/logo-glossary-min.png){width="176"}

Add glossaries to markdown and quarto documents by tagging individual
words. Definitions can be provided inline or in a separate file.
<br/></br>\
There is a lot of necessary jargon to learn reading new books. The goal
of {**glossary**} is to provide a lightweight solution for making
glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown.
This package provides functions to link terms in text to their
definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary
table of all linked terms at the end of a section.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the meantime {**glossary**} is for me a very important learning
vehicle. Whenever an expression appears with a doubled underlined link I
know that I will get more information by hovering the mouse over the
underlined text.

There is a little inconvenience with abbreviation that could also be
part of another glossary entry text string (e.g.,
`r glossary("APIx", "API")` and `r glossary("Capital Income")`). My
workaround is to end the short abbreviation with an additional 'x' and
then to call the glossary with the x-version follwed by the text that
should be appear in the document (e.g., *r glossary("APIx", "API")*).
This double format is a standard feature of the {**glossary**} package
so that you can adapt the appearing text to the glossary entry (e.g.,
singular/plural or other grammar changes).
