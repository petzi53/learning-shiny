::: {.my-objectives-container}


In this chapter I will collect all the tasks still to do. 

The lists will not only cover things to do for this book, but also other more general issues I came about working on this book. The task list will be divided into different subjects:

- **Book content**: ToDo list for this book covering all content tasks, like missing chapters, text modules, bibliographies, references, links etc. This section also includes the polishing of text passages in grammar and style, improving arguments with a better text structure, more understandable graphics, etc.
- **Book appearance**: Creating colored and numbered textboxes for different subjects by adapting the `r glossary("CSS")` for this book and/or using Quartos layout facilities.
- **Shiny**: List of things to learn even if those subjects are not the scope of this book. This includes also the `shinylive` extension and the {**shinylive**} package.
- **Quarto**: Researching Quarto functionality to enhance this book but also more general to improve my knowledge about Quarto. This includes Quarto extension, static and dynamic formats for [Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto-formats), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), including {{< latex >}} with type setting systems like [Typst](https://typst.app/)/[TyX](https://tyx-editor.com/) or [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/). Applying interactivity and animation with other packages like {**leaflet**}, {**plotly**}, {**htmlwidgets**}, but also using JavaScript, JavaScript frameworks like [Observable JS](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/) and more.
- **R**: Last but not least I stumble often over new R functions and packages that I should investigate more in detail.
- **Miscellaneous**:If I sometimes do not know definitely in which category one task belongs I will guess it and add it to the miscellaneous task list. This duplicate will get a reference to the subject oriented lists and vice versa. 

::: {.callout-important #imp-annex-todo-objective}
My aim is to clean up all tasks under Book content and Book appearance and to transfer the other todo list to my other relevant note-books.
