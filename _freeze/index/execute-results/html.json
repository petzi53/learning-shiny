Currently I am working on @sec-chap07.\n\nExercises @sec-chap04_8_exercises and @sec-chap06-5_4_exercises are missing.\n\n:::\n\n:::::{.my-watch}\n:::{.my-watch-header}\nWATCH OUT: This is neither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.\n:::\n::::{.my-watch-container}\n\nI am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to\nbecome explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.\nPlease keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a\nlearner.\n\nText passages with content I am already familiar I have skipped. Section\nof the original text where I needed more in-depth knowledge I have\nelaborated and added my own comments resulted from my personal research.\n\nBe warned! In spite of replicating most of the content this Quarto book\nmay contain many mistakes. All the misapprehensions and errors are of\ncourse my own responsibility.\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n\n## Content and Goals of this Book {.unnumbered}\n\nThis Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of\n[Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by Hadley Wickham [@wickham2021].\n\nI am learning wot work with {**shiny**} because I want to develop a dashboard for investigating countries in world maps with values of different years. For instance I want to use the <a class='glossary' title='The World Happiness Reports are a partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHR’s Editorial Board. The report is produced under the editorial control of the WHR Editorial Board. The Reports reflects a worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and well-being as criteria for government policy. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. (https://worldhappiness.report/about/)'>WHR</a> data 2011, 2012, 2014-2024 and show the distributions of the ladder scores abount the countries of the world.\n\n\n\n## Text passages\n\n### Quotes and personal comments\n\nMy text consists mostly of quotes from the [Mastering Shiny book](https://www.amazon.de/Mastering-Shiny-Interactive-Reports-Dashboards/dp/1492047384/). Sometimes I have them changed slightly to adapt it to the flow of my notes. But I have not shown that it is a quote nor I jave referenced the position of the (semi)quotes in the book. As I am generally follow the book's outline using the same text for headers, it should be clear where to find the quotes. \n\nThis means that most of the text in this Quarto book is not mine but comes\nfrom different resources. \n\nMy personal comments should be clear because most of the times it is a reflection about the book and my experiences with it.\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n\nI am using the {**glossary**} package [@glossary] to create links to glossary\nentries.\n\n::: my-r-code\n::: my-r-code-header\n::: {#cnj-load-glossary}\n: Load glossary\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-r-code-container\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{#lst-preface-load-glossary .r .cell-code  lst-cap=\"Install and load the glossary package with the appropriate glossary.yml file\"}\n## 1. Install the glossary package:\n## https://debruine.github.io/glossary/\n\nlibrary(glossary)\n\n## If you want to use my glossary.yml file:\n\n## 1. fork my repo\n##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb\n\n## 2. Download the `glossary.yml` file from\n##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml)\n\n## 3. Store the file on your hard disk\n##    and change the following path accordingly\n\nglossary::glossary_path(\"../glossary-pb/glossary.yml\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nIf you hover with your mouse over the double underlined links it opens\nan window with the appropriate glossary text. Try this example: <a class='glossary' title='The World Happiness Reports are a partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHR’s Editorial Board. The report is produced under the editorial control of the WHR Editorial Board. The Reports reflects a worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and well-being as criteria for government policy. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. (https://worldhappiness.report/about/)'>WHR</a>.\n\n::: my-watch-out\n::: my-watch-out-header\nWATCH OUT! Glossary is my private learning vehicle\n:::\n\n::: my-watch-out-container\n::: {layout=\"[10, 30]\" layout-valign=\"center\"}\n![](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/logo.png)\n\nI have added many of the glossary entries when I was working through\nother books either taking the text passage of these books I was reading\nor via an internet recherche from other resources. Sometimes I have added the\nsource of the glossary entry as an abbreviation or as an URL. Many definitions were provided by the KI provided within the search of my [Brave browser](https://brave.com/).\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\nIf you fork [my repository of these notes](https://github.com/petzi53/learning-shiny) then the glossary will not\nwork out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file from [my\nglossary-pb GitHub\nrepo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),\nstore it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk\n@lst-preface-load-glossary accordingly.\n\nIn any case I am the only responsible person for the glossary text, especially\nif I have used text from other resources wrongly. Again: The main purpose of the glossary is to support my personal learning venture.\n\n## R Code and Datasets\n\nDuring coding I am following the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). For learning purposes I am practicing {**shiny**} in two modes:\n\n1. **{shiny} app**: I am writing the code in extra `app.R` files as explained in the book. I create folders with the number of the chapters, eg., `apps-01`, `apps-02`. Inside of these chapter folders I put the folders for the {**shiny**} examples with self explanatory names so that one can get and distinguish the example files that all have the name `app.R`. Additionally I order these examples with numbers that represents their appearance in the text, e.g., `01-hello-world`, `02-greetings1` `03-greetings2`, etc. \n2. **{shinylife-r}**: Additionally I provide the example as standalone {**shinylive**} Quarto examples. They have two different version: One is the source code shown as code listing but not evaluated. The other is the working {**shinylive**} example.  This seems to me a nice way to communicate my learning experiences and the results of the {**shiny**} code. All these code chunks start with `{shinylive-r}` instead `{r}` in the header.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\nI am not using always the exact code snippets of the book,\nbecause I am not only replicating the code to see how it works but also\nto change the values of parameters to observe their influences.\n:::\n\n## Annex\n\nIn some of my book notes I provide files in the annex. They contain experiments not directly in line with the book but inspired by my reading of the book. \n\nOften you will also find an annex file with a standardized short description of all my used packages, sometimes added with notes about my personal experiences with this package. An example of the standardized format gives you the following @sec-glossary-package.\n\n### Glossary package {#sec-glossary-package}\n:::::: my-num-packagebox\n::: my-num-packagebox-header\nPackage Profile: glossary\n:::\n\n:::: my-num-packagebox-container\n<center>{**glossary**}: [Glossaries for Markdown and Quarto Documents](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/) [@glossary]</center>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {layout=\"[10, 30]\" layout-valign=\"center\"}\n![](img/logoi/logo-glossary-min.png){width=\"176\"}\n\nAdd glossaries to markdown and quarto documents by tagging individual words. Definitions can be provided inline or in a separate file. <br/></br>   \nThere is a lot of necessary jargon to learn reading new books. The goal of {**glossary**} is to provide a lightweight solution for making glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown. This package provides functions to link terms in text to their definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary table of all linked terms at the end of a section.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the meantime {**glossary**} is for me a very important learning vehicle. Whenever an expression appears with a doubled underlined link I know that I will get more information by hovering the mouse over the underlined text.\n\nThere is a little inconvenience with abbreviation that could also be part of another glossary entry text string (e.g., <a class='glossary' title='An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies. (IBM)'>API</a> and <a class='glossary' title='Capital income is defined as the sum of property income, including dividends, interest gains, reinvested earnings on foreign direct investment, investment income disbursements and land rents (Distributional National Accounts (DINA) for Austria, 2004-2016).'>Capital Income</a>). My workaround is to end the short abbreviation with an additional 'x' and then to call the glossary with the x-version follwed by the text that should be appear in the document (e.g., *r glossary(\"APIx\", \"API\")*). This double format is a standard feature of the {**glossary**} package so that you can adapt the appearing text to the glossary entry (e.g., singular/plural or other grammar changes).\n\n\n::::\n::::::\n\n\n\n\n## Resources\n\n::: {.my-resource}\n::: {.my-resource-header}\n:::::: {#lem-index-book-resources}\n: Resources used for this Quarto book\n::::::\n:::\n\n::: {.my-resource-container}\n\n- Wickham, H.
