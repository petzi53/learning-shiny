The task list will be divided into different subjects:\n\n- **Book content**: ToDo list for this book covering all content tasks, like missing chapters, text modules, bibliographies, references, links etc. This section also includes the polishing of text passages in grammar and style, improving arguments with a better text structure, more understandable graphics, etc. I have also edited a section with my own challenges, i.e., exercises their idea came up when I worked with an example.\n- **Book appearance**: Creating colored and numbered textboxes for different subjects by adapting the <a class='glossary' title='Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. (Wikipedia)'>CSS</a> for this book and/or using Quartos layout facilities.\n- **Shiny**: List of things to learn even if those subjects are not the scope of this book. This includes not only the `shinylive` extension and the {**shinylive**} package using here in this book, but also the many packages supporting Shiny, helper in the Shiny universe.\n- **Quarto**: Researching Quarto functionality to enhance this book but also more general to improve my knowledge about Quarto. This includes Quarto extension, static and dynamic formats for [Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto-formats), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), including {{< latex >}} with type setting systems like [Typst](https://typst.app/)/[TyX](https://tyx-editor.com/) or [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/). Applying interactivity and animation with other packages like {**leaflet**}, {**plotly**}, {**htmlwidgets**}, but also using JavaScript, JavaScript frameworks like [Observable JS](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/) and more.\n- **R**: Last but not least I stumble often over new R functions and packages that I should investigate more in detail.\n- **Miscellaneous**:If I sometimes do not know definitely in which category one task belongs I will guess it and add it to the miscellaneous task list. This duplicate will get a reference to the subject oriented lists and vice versa. \n\n::: {.callout-important #imp-annex-todo-objective}\nMy aim is to clean up all tasks under Book content and Book appearance and to transfer the other todo list to my other relevant note-books.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n::::\n:::::\n\n## Book content {#sec-annex-todo-book-content}\n\n### All chapters\n\n- [ ] add glossary list and sessions_info\n- [ ] revise/write all **chapter objectives** (overviews)\n- [ ] add references to Hadley live demos (where and how?)\n- [ ] revise all apps-XX folders: rename folder and add comments (name, purpose etc.) An example can be found in \"apps09/download-report-github/app.R\"\n- [ ] reference packages to their package profiles\n- [x] ~~delete in the code chunks all lines with `library(shiny)` and add it for each chapter only once in the setup chunk.~~ [setup chunk does not work with shinylive-r standalone = TRUE]{.mark}.  \n- [ ] delete all `shiny::<function()>` references, but keep or add all the other package references. Add/keep `shiny::` if it could be confused with another package just mentioned.\n- [ ] change all code examples in the first three chapters with to see Shiny in a horizontal section and not in an additional tab.\n- [ ] change the reference to external R file(s) (applying what I have learned from my [Posit post](https://forum.posit.co/t/shinylive-r-cannot-include-r-file/202123/6).\n- [ ] wait for an answer to [my question on Posit](https://forum.posit.co/t/shinylive-r-with-renderimage/202516) about displaying images with shinylive.\n- [ ] use [Grammarly App](https://www.grammarly.com/desktop/mac) and [Grammarly browser extension](https://www.grammarly.com/browser) to get better English\n\n### annex chapter \"package used\"\n\n- [x] `citeproc` in \"Packages used\" (@sec-annex-package-used)\n- [x] Clean it from previous note book\n- [x] Update it to contain all the packages already mentioned or used\n- [x] Add {**withr**}, {**progress**} and {**shinycssloaders**}\n- [ ] Mark those package that are essential for learning shiny (and the Mastering Shiny book).\n\n### Chapter 03\n\n- [ ] finish my own summary of `@sec-chap03` about reactive expressions\n\n### Clean & Check\n\n- [ ] internal links/references if a chapter is finished\n- [ ] all the (render) test files in the \"learning-shiny\" directory resp do not git these folders or files.\n\n### Errors to investigate\n\n- [ ] Downloading reports: {#sec-09downloading-reports-standard}\n- [ ] Downloading reports: {#sec-09downloading-reports-callr}\n\n\n### Index file\n\n- [ ] describe method for `<package>::<function()>` references\n- [ ] describe method to develop Shiny apps and their usage in the Quarto code chunks. This includes also the usage of the apps-XX directories.\n- [ ] explain external functions used in \"R/helper\"\n- [ ] explain text bookmarks like `@XXX_<section_number>`\n\n### Missing exercises\n\n- [ ] @sec-chap04_8_exercises, \n- [ ] @sec-chap06-5_4_exercises\n\n### My own challenges\n\n- [ ] experiment with actionButtons in @sec-02-action-buttons\n- [ ] start and reset button @cnj-08-progressive-updates\n- [ ] load multiple file: @cnj-09-file-upload-server\n- [ ] pre-filter the list of datasets to get only data frames in @cnj-09-downloading-data\n\n\n\n## Book appearance {#sec-annex-todo-book-appearance}\n\n### CSS\n\n- [x] resource box needs more space at the top (padding-top)\n- [x] limit right margin of boxes inside boxes with `padding-right: 10px` in container\n- [ ] get correct header for numbered box without preset theorem variation  (black instead of grey and in line with the number, at the moment the title is one line lower than the number) Ask at StackOverflow?\n- [ ] reorganize my callout boxes\n- [ ] create annex about all my boxes\n\n### Quarto {#sec-annex-todo-quarto}\n\n- [x] small check mark boxes at the beginning of the line (See [Markdown Basics: Lists](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#lists))\n- [x] how to put ticks in these check mark boxes interactively (disappears after page reloading)\n- [ ] better font for plot axes     \n- [ ] use [diagrams](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html) for developing reactive graphs \n- [ ] how and when to use screenshots / graphics with 3D-margin but still working with [lightbox](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-lightbox-figures.html)\n\n## Shiny {#sec-annex-todo-shiny}\n\n- [x] How to source external files for `shinylive` extension (See [Posit answer](https://forum.posit.co/t/shinylive-r-cannot-include-r-file/202123/8))\n- [ ] How to work in `shinylive` with external images: via an [URL to an external website](https://forum.posit.co/t/shinylive-r-with-renderimage/202516/10), but I believe there is another solution with local images too. May the problem is related with the {**shinylive**} package (not the extension)\n\n\n## R {#sec-annex-todo-r}\n\n- [ ] report {**glossary**} issue when [content of a term is part of another term](https://github.com/debruine/glossary/issues/11)\n- [ ] look into [Posit Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud/)\n\n\n## Quarto computation\n\n- [ ] how to use cache to make the rendering process of this book faster\n- [ ] how about the {**munsell**} package problem with {**ggplot2**}\n\n## Miscellanoeus\n\n- [ ] Look at the [list of awesome shiny extensions](https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions)\n- [ ] Hypothes.is preparation to get highlighted data similar to Zotero.
